🪓 Why you DON'T need GraphQL! 

GraphQL was introduced as an API style allowing you to request "exactly what you need" from an API.
In "boring" words, it solves the problem of over-fetching.

However, there's a much simpler, REST-compliant way to solve this:

👉 An "include" query parameter. 

Here's a quick comparison:

📦 Over-fetching:

GraphQL: Makes you specify everything ✅
Include: Lets you opt-in for extras ✅

🥚 Simplicity:

GraphQL: A whole API style ❌
Include: Just a query parameter ✅

🧩 Compatibility:

GraphQL: You'll need a new API ❌
Include: Fits your existing API ✅

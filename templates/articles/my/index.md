# My Go-To .NET Projects Template

> Overcoming what's missing in the default templates

Although .NET web templates give a solid foundation for your apps, there are still quite a few tasks the default template just doesn't solve. So over the years, I came up with my own template, that addresses all the things I miss in the default template. This article will walk you through the things I've added so you can grab some ideas for your own projects.

## There's a Gift in the End!

The article walks you through the things I include in every project I have. You can take some ideas from the article, or simply use my go-to template, which is available [here on github](https://github.com/astorDev/nist/tree/main/templates/dotnet). 

Give the template a try! And also... claps are appreciated ðŸ‘‰ðŸ‘ˆ

🏇🏾 The Dark Horse of an Event-Driven Architecture.

People usually choose between RabbitMQ and Kafka when implementing server-side event-based communication.
Although I respect both instruments and enjoy what they are offering, my bet in this race is different:

👉 Webhooks

Here are the 3 advantages that sold me on them:

✅ No Vendor Lock-In
✅ No Infrastructure Setup Needed
✅ Lets a receiver use existing REST infrastructure

However, there's not much tooling or guidance on implementing webhook senders! 
I've tried to fix this unfairness in the recent Medium article:

Have a nice (and hopefully useful) read!

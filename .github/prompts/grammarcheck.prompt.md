I want you to find:

4. Use of articles (a, the)
5. s in the end of (s
6. Anything else that is strictly related to grammar.

I DO NOT want you to check:

1. Text style
2. Code Snippets, their parts, anything resembling code.

Do not suggest a new version, only state what's wrong.

Go sentence by sentence first, then present a short list of the errors found.

## Response Format

- Present each sentence on its own line.
- For correct sentences mark them with on the same line "✅"
- For each mistake mark it with ⚠️, Surround things to remove with markdown throughline `~~x~~` and what needs to be inserted as `**x**` bold markdonw
- For notes (that are not strictly a grammar mistake) only annotate with 📝 with short clarification.
- Follow example formatting as strict as possible

**Example:**

**Sentence-by-sentence analysis:**

Enums in APIs are surprisingly tricky. ✅  

There are multiple approaches to representing enums, each problematic in its own 
[⚠️ way~~s~~ -> way].  

In this article, we are going to take a look [⚠️ ~~in~~ -> **at**] different ways of representing enums in .NET.

For each approach we will take a look at what we will get in terms of [⚠️ ~~Open API~~ -> **OpenAPI**] description and even [📝 _improve it for a few_ - awkward].  

In this article, we've implemented extension methods for improving the way enums are [⚠️ ~~representation~~ -> **represented** ] in OpenAPI documents.

Instead of recreating the logic from scratch[**,** - ⚠️  missing comma] you can use the following NuGet package:

### ⚠️ Errors found

- "ways" should be "way" or "their own ways"
- "take a look in" should be "take a look at"
- "Open API" should be "OpenAPI"
- "enums are representation" should be "enums are represented"
- Missing comma after "scratch"

### 📝 Notes

- "improve it for a few" is awkward.
